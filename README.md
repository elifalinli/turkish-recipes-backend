# turkish-recipes-backend

I am setting up a back-end of an app which will contain some traditional Turkish recipes that I cook and love.

I use MongoDB as my database, my stack also contains Node.js and Express.js. I test the app with Insomnia and I use Nodemon module to track the changes.

This project aims to sharpen my back-end skills but I plan on adding an front-end to it too after completing the back-end.
